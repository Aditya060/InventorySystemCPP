# Inventory System CPP

## About
The Inventory System CPP project contains a basic multiplayer supported inventory system featuring equip-able and usable items. The project is developed essentially on C++.

The technical demo included is an MMO styled example with a Drag & Drop UI. This demo showcases how quick it is to implement and use the Inventory System in your own project.
